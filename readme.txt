Allows you to display the feed of a public page or profile on your website. Requires that you create a Facebook Application.

== Description ==

Retrieve the feed of a *public* Facebook page or profile using the Facebook Graph API and the Facebook PHP SDK. You will need to have or create a Facebook application to use this plugin as it is required to use their graph api.

The options let you define a default feed that is used anywhere you call the plugin. You may also specify specific feeds to display in different areas.

= Ways to Use =

* **Widget** Display a feed using a widget.
* **Shortcode** Display a feed in a post or page using the shortcode tag `[fb_feed]`.
* **PHP Direct Use** Display a feed anywhere in your theme by adding `<?php fb_feed() ?>` where you wish the feed to be displayed.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `facebook-feed-grabber/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to the Facebook Feed Grabber options page and enter your Facebook App Id and Secret. If don't have a Facebook App then head on over to the [Facebook Developers App](https://developers.facebook.com/apps "Facebook Developers") page and create one.
4. Set your default page id and any other settings you wish to adjust.

= Ways to Display the Feed =

To display the default feed using the other default settings do any of the following.

* **Widget** Visit the widgets area and add the Facebook Feed Grabber Widget where you wish to display the feed.
* **Shortcode** Add the shortcode tag `[fb_feed]` to any page or post to display the feed from within that page/post.
* **PHP Direct Use** Display a feed anywhere in your theme by adding `<?php fb_feed() ?>` where you wish the feed to be displayed.

= Advanced Usage =

If you need to display one or more feeds in different locations and you need to vary the settings for each instance this section is for you. Don't let the term "Advanced Usage" scare you.

The following are settings that can be changed for each feed you display. (Currently not available for the widgets)

* **cache_feed** - *int* ~ The number of minutes to cache the feed for. 
	>Defaults to the value of "Cache Feed" from the plugin's options page.
	
* **container** - *string* ~ The element to wrap the feed items in. If NULL then no container is used.
	>Defaults to *'div'*.
	
* **container_id** - *string* ~ The ID of the container element. If left empty or contains 0 then no container ID will be set.
	>Defaults to *'fb-feed'*.
	
* **container_class** - *string* ~ The class of the container element. If left empty or contains 0 then container class will be set. 
	>Defaults to *'fb-feed'*.
	
* **limit** - *boolean* ~ Whether to limit the feed to posts by the feed author. Pass 1 for true or 0 for false when using the `[fb_feed]` shortcode. 
	>Defaults to the value of "Limit to Posts From Feed" from the plugin's options page.
	
* **echo** - *boolean* ~ Echo the results when true else it returns the results. Only works when calling `fb_feed()` in PHP.
	>Defaults to *true*.
	
* **maxitems => $options['num_entries']** - *int* ~ Limits the number of entries displayed. 
	>Defaults to the value of "Number of Entries" from the plugin's options page.
	
* **show_title** - *boolean* ~ Whether to show the Facebook page title before the feed. Pass 1 for true or 0 for false when using the `[fb_feed]` shortcode tag.
	>Defaults to *true*.

Arguments can be passed to `fb_feed($feed_id, $args)` as an array in $args or as key=value pairs in the [fb_feed] shortcode tag. For examples keep reading.

= Examples =

To display the feed defined on the options page in a post or page without the page title use,
`[fb_feed show_title=1]`

To do the same in a template file use,
`<?php fb_feed( null, array('show_title' => false) ); ?>`

To display a feed not defined on the options page, change the max number of entries to show to 6 and change the container ID use the following,
`[fb_feed container_id='facebook-feed' maxitems=6]101359869934470[/fb_feed]`

To do the same in a template file use,
`<?php fb_feed( '101359869934470', array('container_id' => 'facebook-feed', 'maxitems' => 6) ); ?>`

If you are going to show more that one feed in a template file I suggest doing something like the following,
`<?php
// Call the class to make the initial connection.
$facebook = new ffg();

// Display the first feed using all default settings
$facebook->feed();

// Display a second feed with the id 101359869934470. You should also change the id of the container for one of the feeds.
// If you use a different container id you can't use the more specefic second default stylesheet.
$facebook->feed('101359869934470', array('container_id'=>'fb-feed-2'));
?>`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get a Facebook App ID & Secret? =

First you will need a [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com) account, then you must register as a Facebook Developer at [www.facebook.com/developers/apps.php](https://www.facebook.com/developers/apps.php "Facebook Developer Apps") where you can then create your Facebook application. After you create your application you will be given and App ID and Secret.

= How do I find the ID to access my page or profile? =

One way is to go to one of the photo albums from your Facebook page or profile and look at the URL. For example here is the profile pictures album for Rehema Ministries Facebook page.
* [Wordpress](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=101360063267784&set=a.101360059934451.1955.101359869934470&type=1&theater "Rehema Ministries dba/In Step Foundation, Kenya")
Notice in the 'set' variable of that link the last set of numbers after the last period. In this case those numbers are '101359869934470'. That should be the id of your page or profile.

= Why isn't my feed displaying anything? =

My first guess is that your content isn't set to be public or you haven't provided a valid Facebook page id.

= Why do I get a "PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught OAuthException: Invalid OAuth access token signature." =

Because you have either supplied an invalid App Id & Secret combo or you're trying to access something you don't have permissions for.
